    Arma 3 is a open world MILSIM that allows you to be a civilian, OPFOR(Russia), BLUFOR(The NATO forces) And INDEP(Independed terrorist or private military orginazations).
    Arma 3 also has a large amount of servers which all have a different thing, from Life Simulators, to combat missions and group leading missions.
    You can fly, drive, and control boats, planes, and cars, Each has a limited amount of fuel you can fill at fuel tanks and helicoptors have physics that are similiar to real life as with planes.
    If you want to fight another army all you have to do is open the editor and add combatants.
    Finally it has built on missions so If you get bored, you can just go and do missions.
