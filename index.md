Crpyography is difficult and it needs practice.
We used code wheels that match up letters.
I also learned that different codes with numbers are simple.

# Computer Networking 9/14/2018
This week I learned how a computer's IP works.
I also learned that a computer's port isn't just for games.
I learned that your IP changes from place to place, so if I go home my computer's IP changes.
I learned how much a website costs, and that you can make websites with the same name but with a few differences like .com, or .org.
Finally I learned what LAN can also be used for.
